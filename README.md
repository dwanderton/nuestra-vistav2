Nuestra Vista
=============
Nuestra Vista is an mobile app enabling the creation of sharable provocative side-by-side comparisons of before and after the destruction caused by Hurricane Maria. These images of the urban environment and critical infrastructure not only allow individuals to effectively share and comment upon the current state, but also to reflect upon the efforts being made to restore facilities that are underway.

From the data generated, through enabling individual actions, the application  will create detailed mappings of the current status through a bottom up approach. These mappings and images can be utilized in arenas from news reportage and first response efforts through to directing longer term local and federal government interventions.

It is planned that the first uses of this application will be in Puerto Rico, and that through this use a more generalized application can be built to assist in areas struck by future disasters.
